# Introduction

Redux: a system to manage global app state

## Guiding Principles

1. A single source of truth ("global state")
2. State is read-only("actions")
3. Changes are made with pure functions ("reducers")

## Fundamentals

1. Actions & action creators
2. Dispatch
3. Reducers
4. Store

## Restaurant Analogy

1. Your order -> `action`
2. Restaurant server -> `dispatch`
3. Chef -> `reducer`
